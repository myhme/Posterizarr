## Introduction
This PowerShell script automates the process of generating images for your Plex/Jellyfin/Emby media library. Leveraging information from your Plex/Jellyfin/Emby library, such as movie or show titles, season and episode data, it fetches relevant artwork from Fanart.tv, TMDB, TVDB, Plex and IMDB. The script is able to focus on artwork with specific languages to grab. By default, textless artwork `xx` is retrieved and will fall back to `en` if textless is not found. This is a setting a user can decide on, either to focus on textless or on text posters. It also offers both automatic and manual modes for generating posters. The manual mode can accommodate custom creations that cannot be bulk retrieved.

> [!NOTE]
Posterizarr is cross-platform ready, meaning it can run on Linux (also arm), [Docker (Ubuntu 22.04 Base Image) does not work on ARM](#docker), [unRAID](#unraid) and on Windows operating systems.
>
> **Supported Poster Types:**
>- Movie/Show Posters
>- Movie/Show Backgrounds
>- Season Posters
>- TitleCards

> [!TIP]
> Here is an installation [walkthrough](walkthrough.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You do not have to redeploy the container if the script version changes because it is not part of the container.
> Container rebuilds only happen when there are changes to the ImageMagick, PowerShell, or other prerequisite versions.
>
> Do not enable more then one media server.
>
> If you want to install it on ARM please follow this carefully [ARM prerequisites](walkthrough.md#arm-prerequisites)


> [!WARNING]
>- The `temp` Folder gets cleared on every Script run, so do not put files into it.
>- **[Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki)** integration only works in docker container, please use discord on other platforms **(discord also works on docker)**.
>- **Please start the script as Admin on first run, otherwise the script is not able to install the prerequisites.**


## Main Capabilities of Posterizarr

| **Feature**                      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Kometa Integration**           | -**Tip:** For users of Kometa (formerly PMM), Posterizarr organizes assets using the Kometa-compatible folder structure required for seamless integration: **[Assets Documentation](https://kometa.wiki/en/latest/kometa/guides/assets/)**.<br>- **Example Config**: See **[Kometa-Configs repo](https://github.com/Kometa-Team/Community-Configs/blob/master/fscorrupt/config.yml)** for sample configuration to streamline asset management.                                                                      |
| **Direct Upload to Media Servers** | - Posterizarr can directly upload artwork to media servers:<br> &nbsp; - **Plex**: Uploads artwork if Kometa isn’t used.<br> &nbsp; - **Jellyfin**: Directly uploads artwork.<br> &nbsp; - **Emby**: Similarly, uploads artwork directly.                    |
| **Upload Existing Assets**               | - Configure whether to **upload pre-existing assets** to Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby, saving time by skipping redundant uploads for libraries with complete artwork.                                                                     |
| **Backup Functionality**         | - Facilitates artwork **backup** by downloading all assets from **Plex** to a specified **backup share**.<br>- Supports the **Kometa folder structure** for organized storage.                                                                             |
| **Manual Asset Path (Local Assets)** | - **Local Asset Preference**: Prioritizes assets from a **manual asset path** if present. Skips download if local assets are available.<br>- **Path Configuration**: Specify the folder structure in the configuration, saving time and bandwidth by using pre-existing images. |
| **Resizing**                     | - Automatically resizes all **poster images** to **2000x3000** for optimized media server use.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

> [!NOTE]
>Upon initial execution, the script may take some time to run as it compiles necessary data. Subsequent runs will look at whether a poster in the AssetPath is missing and only create missing posters, bypassing existing assets in the directory. If you are unhappy with the downloaded artwork, delete it in the AssetPath directory, rerun and the script will populate the missing artwork.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>**Requirements:**
>
>Before utilizing the script, ensure the following prerequisites are installed and configured:

>- **TMDB API Read Access Token:** [Obtain TMDB API Token](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
    - **NOTE** the **TMDB API Read Access Token** is the really, really long one
>- **Fanart Personal API Key:** [Obtain Fanart API Key](https://fanart.tv/get-an-api-key)
>- **TVDB API Key:** [Obtain TVDB API Key](https://thetvdb.com/api-information/signup)
    - **Do not** use `"Legacy API Key"`, it only works with a Project Api Key.
>- **ImageMagick:**
    - **Version 7.x is required** - The script handles downloading and using a portable version of ImageMagick for all platforms. **(You may need to run the Script as Admin on first run)**. If you prefer to reference your own installation or prefer to download and install it yourself, goto: [Download ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php)
>- **Powershell Version:** 5.x or higher (Docker Image uses v7.4.6).
>- **FanartTv Powershell Module:** This module is required (already integrated in container), goto: [Install Module](https://github.com/Celerium/FanartTV-PowerShellWrapper)

# Configuration

1. Open `config.example.json` located in the script directory.
2. Update the following variables with your API keys and preferences:

    <details close>
    <summary>ApiPart [click to unfold]</summary>
    <br>

    - `tvdbapi`: Your TVDB Project API key.
       - If you are a TVDB subscriber, you can append your PIN to the end of your API key in the format `YourApiKey#YourPin`. (It is important to include a `#` between the API key and the PIN.)
    - `tmdbtoken`: Your TMDB API Read Access Token.
    - `FanartTvAPIKey`: Your Fanart personal API key.
    - `PlexToken`: Your Plex token (Leave empty if not applicable).
    - `JellyfinAPIKey`: Your Jellyfin API key. (You can create an API key from inside Jellyfin at Settings > Advanced > Api Keys.)
    - `EmbyAPIKey`: Your Emby API key. (You can create an API key from inside Emby at Settings > Advanced > Api Keys.)
    - `FavProvider`: Set your preferred provider (default is `tmdb`).
        - possible values are:
            -    `tmdb` (recommended)
            -    `fanart`
            -    `tvdb`
            -    `plex` (Not recommended)
                  - if you prefer textless, do not set plex as fav provider as i cannot query if it has text or not.
                  - that beeing said, plex should act as last resort like IMDB does for Movies and not as fav provider.

            [Search order in script](#Search-Order)
    - `WidthHeightFilter`: If set to `true`, an additional resolution filter will be applied to Posters/Backgrounds (TMDB and TVDB) and Titlecards (only on TMDB) searches.

    - `PosterMinHeight`: Minimum poster height filter—greater than or equal to: `3000` (default value)
    - `BgTcMinWidth`: Minimum background/titlecard width filter—greater than or equal to: `3840` (default value)
    - `BgTcMinHeight`: Minimum background/titlecard height filter—greater than or equal to: `2160` (default value)
    - `tmdb_vote_sorting`: Picture sorting via TMDB api, either by `vote_average`, `vote_count` or by `primary` (Default value is: `vote_average`).
        - `primary` = default tmdb view (like on the website)
    - `PreferredLanguageOrder`: Specify language preferences. Default is `xx,en,de` (`xx` is Textless). Example configurations can be found in the config file. 2-digit language codes can be found here: [ISO 3166-1 Lang Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).
      - If you set it to `xx` you tell the script it should only search for textless, posters with text will be skipped.
    - `PreferredSeasonLanguageOrder`: Specify language preferences for seasons. Default is `xx,en,de` (`xx` is Textless). Example configurations can be found in the config file. 2-digit language codes can be found here: [ISO 3166-1 Lang Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).
    - `PreferredBackgroundLanguageOrder`: Specify language preferences for backgrounds. Default is `PleaseFillMe` ( It will take your poster lang order / `xx` is Textless). Example configurations can be found in the config file. 2-digit language codes can be found here: [ISO 3166-1 Lang Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).
      - If you set it to `xx` you tell the script it should only search for textless, posters with text will be skipped.

        - !! IMPORTANT !! -

        Risk of Data Loss from excluded Libraries:

        When you exclude libraries, any assets within these locations may be inadvertently deleted.

        This happens because the script interprets these assets as "not needed anymore" during its execution since they are not found or listed as part of the active scan.

        Ensure that all active asset libraries are included when using that setting on true to prevent unintended deletions.
        ```
    - `AutoUpdateIM` : Set to `true` to AutoUpdate Imagemagick Portable Version (Does not work with Docker/Unraid).
      - Doing this could break things, cause you then uses IM Versions that are not tested with Posterizarr.

3. Rename the config file to `config.json`.
4. Place the `overlay.png`, or whatever file you defined earlier in `overlayfile`, and `Rocky.ttf` font, or whatever font you defined earlier in `font` files in the same directory as Posterizarr.ps1 which is `$ScriptRoot`.

## Usage
- **Automatic Mode**: Execute the script without any parameters to generate posters for your entire Plex library.
- **Testing Mode**: Run the script with the `-Testing` switch to create Test posters before you start using it.
- **Manual Mode**: Run the script with the `-Manual` switch to create custom posters manually.
- **Backup Mode**: Run the script with the `-Backup` switch to download every artwork from plex (only those what are set to `true` in config)

> [!NOTE]
>- Ensure PowerShell execution policy allows script execution.
>- Bugs or issues encountered during usage can be reported for resolution.


### Automatic Mode

Run the script without any parameters:

```powershell
.\Posterizarr.ps1
```

This will generate posters for your entire Plex library based on the configured settings.

The posters are all placed in `AssetPath\...`. This can then be mounted in Kometa to use as the assets folder.

### Assets Tip
> [!TIP]
> Have a look at the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/fscorrupt/Posterizarr/blob/fb5189043e0c54dc8ee59579612162ab4ffc9b6c/docker-compose.yml#L20) there is an example of the `/assets` Volume, you either can mount the Kometa Assets dir to Posterizarr or vice versa, its up to you.
>
>Its important that you update the containerpath you specified in your docker-compose.yml in your config.json, in my example it is `/assets`.
>
> - [IMAGE ASSET DIRECTORY GUIDE](https://kometa.wiki/en/latest/kometa/guides/assets/#image-asset-directory-guide)
>
> Assuming you made the config like i did, Posterizarr will now create the Posters directly in Kometa´s Asset dir.
>
> If you use Kometa make sure to set this settings on each Library in Kometa Config:
```yaml
libraries:
  4K TV Shows:
    settings:
      asset_directory: /assets/4K TV Shows
      prioritize_assets: true
    operations:
      assets_for_all: true
```


## Modes

### Tautulli Mode Docker
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tautulli and Posterizarr must run as a container in Docker

> [!Note]
> If Discord is configured it will send a Notification on each trigger.

In this mode we use Tautulli to trigger Posterizarr for an specific item in Plex, like a new show, movie or episode got added.

To use it we need to configure a script in Tautulli, please follow these instructions.
1. Make sure that you mount the `Posterizarr` directory to tautulli, cause the script needs the Path `/posterizarr`
    ```yml
    volumes:
      - "/opt/appdata/posterizarr:/posterizarr:rw"
    ```
1. Download the [trigger.py](trigger.py) from the GH and place it in the Tautulli Script dir -> [Tautulli-Wiki](https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli/wiki/Custom-Scripts)
    - You may have to set `chmod +x` to the file.
1. Open Tautulli and go to Settings -> `NOTIFICATION AGENTS`
1. Click on `Add a new notification agent` and select `Script`
1. Specify the script folder where you placed the script and select the script file.
    - You can specify a `Description` at the bottom like i did.

1. Go to `Conditions`, you can now specify when the script should get called.
    - In my case i specified the **Media Type**: `episode, movie, show and season`
    - I also excluded the **Youtube** Lib cause the videos i have there - **do not** have an `tmdb,tvdb or fanart ID`.
      - This is an recommended setting, either exclude such libs or include only those libs where Posterizarr should create art for.

1. Open Tautulli and go to Settings -> `NOTIFICATION AGENTS`
1. Click on `Add a new notification agent` and select `Script`
1. Specify the script folder of Posterizarr and select the script file.
    - Set the script timeout to `0`, which is unlimited. (The default is `30`, which would kill the script before it finishes.)
    - You can specify a `Description` at the bottom like i did.

### Testing Mode

Run the script with the `-Testing` flag. In this mode, the script will create pink posters/backgrounds with short, medium, and long texts (also in CAPS), using the values specified in the `config.json` file.

> [!TIP]
>This is handy for testing your configuration before applying it en masse to the actual posters. You can see how and where the text would be applied, as well as the size of the textbox.

```powershell
.\Posterizarr.ps1 -Testing
```

### Manual Mode

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently only movie/show/season poster creation integrated.
>
> Source picture gets edited by script and  is then moved to desired asset location.

Run the script with the `-Manual` switch:

```powershell
.\Posterizarr.ps1 -Manual
```
Follow the prompts to enter the source picture path (Container needs Access to it), media folder name, and movie/show title to manually create a custom poster.

### Backup Mode

Run the script with the `-Backup` flag. In this mode, the script will download every artwork you have in plex, using the values specified in the `config.json` file.

> [!TIP]
>This is handy for creating a backup or if you want an second assetfolder with kometa/tcm EXIF data for jellyfin/emby.

```powershell
.\Posterizarr.ps1 -Backup
```

### Sync Modes
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The script requires that library names in Plex and Emby/Jellyfin match exactly for the sync to work. It calculates the hash of the artwork from both servers to determine if there are differences, and only syncs the artwork if the hashes do not match.
#### Jellyfin
Run the script with the `-SyncJelly` flag. In this mode, the script will sync every artwork you have in plex to jellyfin.

```powershell
.\Posterizarr.ps1 -SyncJelly
```
#### Emby
Run the script with the `-SyncEmby` flag. In this mode, the script will sync every artwork you have in plex to emby.

```powershell
.\Posterizarr.ps1 -SyncEmby
```
> [!TIP]
>This is handy if you want to run the sync after a kometa run, then you have kometa ovlerayed images in jelly/emby

## Platforms & Tools

### Docker
- [Docker-Compose Example File](docker-compose.yml)
  - Change `RUN_TIME` in yaml to your needs **- You need to use 24H Time Format**
    - The Script gets executed on the Times you specified
    - Before starting the scheduled run it checks if another Posterizarr process is running, if yes - the scheduled run will be skipped.
  - Change `volume` and `network` to fit your environment (Make sure you have the same network as your plex container when you use local IP of plex)
  - Change `TimeZone` to yours, otherwise it will get scheduled to a different time you may want it to.
  - You may also have to change `PUID/PGID`

  If you manually want to run the Script you can do it this way:

  **Automatic Mode:**
  ```sh
  docker exec -it posterizarr s6-setuidgid abc pwsh /config/Posterizarr.ps1
  ```
  **Testing Mode:**
  ```sh
  docker exec -it posterizarr s6-setuidgid abc pwsh /config/Posterizarr.ps1 -Testing
  ```
  **Manual Mode:**
  ```sh
  docker exec -it posterizarr s6-setuidgid abc pwsh /config/Posterizarr.ps1 -Manual
  ```
> [!TIP]
> If you did not used `pwsh` on docker exec you can do it this way.
>
> Inside your `Unraid` or `Bash` or `Sh` console:
> ```sh
> s6-setuidgid abc pwsh /config/Posterizarr.ps1
> s6-setuidgid abc pwsh /config/Posterizarr.ps1 -Manual
> s6-setuidgid abc pwsh /config/Posterizarr.ps1 -Testing
> ```

### unRAID
> [!TIP]
> If you are an unRAID user, just use the Community app from [@nwithan8](https://github.com/nwithan8) it is listed in Store.
>  - Change `RUN_TIME` to your needs **- You need to use 24H Time Format**
>    - Example: `06:00` or `06:00,14:00`.....
>  - AssetPath in config needs to be `/assets` not the path you entered.

Feel free to customize the script further to meet your specific preferences or automation requirements.

## PR Rules

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Adjust on each PR the version number in script on Line 15 `$CurrentScriptVersion = "1.9.7"`
> - Adjust the version number in [Release.txt](Release.txt) to match the one in script.
>   - this is required because the script checks against this file if a newer version is available.
> - Do not include images on a PR.
